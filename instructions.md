There is a channel https://www.youtube.com/@daidaiasmr that have asmr videos in pretty long duration (full stream)

In the comment section of each video, there timestamps like this

"""
3:24 ğŸ‘„ Sounds 
7:05 Wooden Spoon ğŸ¥„ğŸ‘„ Sounds 
10:13 ğŸ‘„ Sounds 
16:23 ğŸ’„
17:50 Oiled Hands movement Sounds 
20:42 Oiled Hands 3dio Ear Massage Sounds 
47:05 ğŸ‘„ Sounds 
48:18 Crinkle Sounds 
51:29 Mic touching Sounds 
1:05:23 censor bar appears 
1:05:40 ğŸ‘„, ğŸ˜› & ğŸ‘… Sounds
"""


I want an app to craw those videos, then take only best parts of each video (
ex: Oiled Hands movement Sounds, Mic touching Sounds, ğŸ‘„ Sounds
) 

then upload clipped video to my own youtube channel

The app should be written in python


I will ask to implement further feature later
